Fine-Grained Urban Change detection using Street view time series - A deep learning based framework for urban transformation Analysis.
Urban environments are constantly evolving due to construction, renovation, infrastructure development, and environmental dynamics. Detecting such changes at a fine-grained level is essential for effective city planning, historical mapping, and infrastructure monitoring. Traditional methods using satellite or aerial imagery often lack the resolution and temporal granularity needed to observe subtle street-level transformations.
In this research, we present a comprehensive implementation of the CityPulse framework, which leverages time-series Google Street View (GSV) imagery to detect and visualize physical changes at urban locations. Our work closely replicates and extends the original CityPulse paper, combining a DINOv2-based Siamese neural network model for change classification with a full pipeline for data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and temporal change point detection.
We collected GSV image sequences from multiple cities, generated image pairs, performed manual labeling on over 1,160 image pairs, and trained a Siamese model achieving an accuracy of 86.6% and an AUC score of 0.93. We further applied the trained model across time-series image sequences to detect significant change events, generate visual timelines with red-box markers, and compute the most impactful year of change for each location.
This fully automated system developed and executed entirely within Google Colab offers a scalable, modular, and reproducible pipeline for fine-grained urban change analysis. By leveraging the high-resolution, ground-level perspective of GSV imagery along with state-of-the-art deep learning models, our framework bridges the gap between computer vision and urban analytics. It serves not only as a research prototype but also as a practical tool for urban planners, policymakers, and remote sensing professionals seeking to monitor transformation with precision and clarity at the street level.
